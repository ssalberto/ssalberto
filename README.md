## Welcome 👋

😄 Hi, I'm Alberto — a passionate Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Engineer based in Valencia, Spain.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a Master's in Artificial Intelligence from *Universidad Politécnica de Valencia*.

🧠 I'm constantly exploring the latest breakthroughs in AI. Whether it's reading up on LLMs and neural network architectures or experimenting with new tools, I love staying at the forefront of this fast-moving field.

🛠️ Some of my hands-on projects include implementing deep learning models, experimenting with transformer-based architectures, and building tools using LangChain and LangGraph. One of my recent projects was a natural language chatbot designed to interact with structured databases — it allows users to query data conversationally without writing SQL.
